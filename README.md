This project is using `pipenv` for dependency management. If you do not have the dependencies for the project installed, you can download [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and run `pipenv install` then `pipenv shell` before opening the Jupyter notebook. This will ensure you are using the same versions as I did when creating the project.
